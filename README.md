# Requirements
os
argparse
datetime
time
importlib
scipy
torch
sklearn

# Usage
We provide a demo of the Indian Pines hyperspectral data for open-set classification. Please note that due to the randomness of the parameter initialization, the experimental results might have slightly different from those reported in the paper. Please refer to the paper for more details.
